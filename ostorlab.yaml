  This repository is an implementation of [Ostorlab Agent](https://pypi.org/project/ostorlab/) for [Subfinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder) discovery tool by by ProjectDiscovery.
  ## Getting Started
  The Subfinder Agent works collectively with other agents. It's job; from a domain name, discover all subdomains in a fast and efficient way, 
  and pass its findings to other agents responsible for scanning the subdomains, for example the [Nuclei agent](https://github.com/Ostorlab/agent_nuclei)
  To perform your first scan, simply run the following command:
  ```shell
  ostorlab scan run --install --agent agent/ostorlab/subfinder --agent agent/ostorlab/nuclei domain-name your-domain.com
  ```
  This command will download and install agents  `agent/ostorlab/subfinder` & `agent/ostorlab/nuclei` and target the domain  `your-domain`.
  Nuclei Agent will scan for <your-domain>, and waits for all subdomains found by the Subfinder Agent to performe other scans.
  You can use any Agent expecting <v3.asset.domain_name> as an in-selector, like Nmap, OpenVas, etc.
  For more information, please refer to the [Ostorlab Documentation](https://github.com/Ostorlab/ostorlab/blob/main/README.md)
  ## Usage
  Agent Subfinder can be installed directly from the ostorlab agent store or built from this repository.
  ### Install directly from ostorlab agent store
  ```shell
  ostorlab agent install agent/ostorlab/subfinder
  ```
  ### Build directly from the repository
  1. To build the Subfinder agent you need to have [ostorlab](https://pypi.org/project/ostorlab/) installed in your machine. If you have already installed ostorlab, you can skip this step.
  ```shell
  pip3 install ostorlab
  ```
  2. Clone this repository.
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/Ostorlab/agent_subfinder.git && cd agent_subfinder
  ```
  3. Build the agent image using ostorlab cli.
  ```shell
  ostorlab agent build --file=ostorlab.yaml
  ```
  You can pass the optional flag `--organization` to specify your organisation. The organization is empty by default.
  4. Run the agent using on of the following commands:
    * If you did not specify an organization when building the image:
      ```shell
      ostorlab scan run --agent agent//subfinder --agent agent//nuclei domain-name your-domain.com
      ```
    * If you specified an organization when building the image:
      ```shell
      ostorlab scan run --agent agent/[ORGANIZATION]/subfinder --agent agent/[ORGANIZATION]/nuclei  domain-name your-domain.com
